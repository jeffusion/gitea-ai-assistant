# AI Code Review System

## Overview

The AI Code Review system is the core feature of this application. It automatically analyzes code changes in Pull Requests and commits, providing insightful feedback using OpenAI's language models.

## Key Components

- **Review Controller**: [src/controllers/review.ts](mdc:src/controllers/review.ts)
  - Handles webhook events from Gitea
  - Routes events to appropriate handlers

- **AI Review Service**: [src/services/ai-review.ts](mdc:src/services/ai-review.ts)
  - Contains the core logic for AI-powered code review
  - Generates both summary comments and line-level feedback
  - Customizable prompts for different review contexts

- **Gitea Service**: [src/services/gitea.ts](mdc:src/services/gitea.ts)
  - Fetches code diffs and file contents from Gitea API
  - Posts review comments back to Gitea

## Review Workflow

1. **Trigger**:
   - Pull Request created/updated or
   - Commit status changes to "success"

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - Fetch diff content from Gitea
   - Process and analyze changes
   - Generate AI prompts with context

3. **AI Review**:
   - Send processed data to OpenAI API
   - Generate summary feedback
   - Generate line-level comments

4. **Feedback Delivery**:
   - Post summary comment to PR or commit
   - Add line comments to specific code sections
   - Apply formatting for better readability

## Customization

The system supports customizable prompts through environment variables:
- `CUSTOM_SUMMARY_PROMPT`: For overall review summaries
- `CUSTOM_LINE_COMMENT_PROMPT`: For line-specific comments

Default prompts are designed to focus on bugs and serious issues rather than style or minor concerns.

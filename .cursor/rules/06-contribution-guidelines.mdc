# Contribution Guidelines

## Code Style and Standards

This project follows TypeScript best practices and uses TSLint for code style enforcement:

- Configuration: [tslint.json](mdc:tslint.json)
- TypeScript settings: [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- Editor config: [.editorconfig](mdc:.editorconfig)

Run the linter to check code style:
```bash
bun run lint
```

## Project Structure Conventions

When contributing to this project, adhere to these structural guidelines:

1. **Controller Layer**:
   - Business logic should be delegated to services
   - Controllers should focus on request handling and response formatting
   - Keep route handlers in the [controllers/](mdc:src/controllers) directory

2. **Service Layer**:
   - External API interactions belong in the [services/](mdc:src/services) directory
   - Each service should have a clear, single responsibility

3. **Configuration**:
   - Environment-based configurations go in [config/index.ts](mdc:src/config/index.ts)
   - Use environment variables for configurable values

4. **Utils**:
   - Reusable utility functions belong in [utils/](mdc:src/utils)
   - Logging should use the custom logger from [utils/logger.ts](mdc:src/utils/logger.ts)

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting Pull Requests:

1. Include a clear description of changes
2. Ensure code passes linting checks
3. Keep changes focused on a single concern
4. Test your changes locally before submitting
